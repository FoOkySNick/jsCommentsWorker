# jsCommentsWorker
This script works with '//TODO name; date; comment' - like comments, that allows to manage them. 

Pros - this allows to change structure of TODO by adding(removing) a field into configuration into 'Titles' and 'ColumnsMaxLength' and adding parsing rules and changing regexp in TODO object. Cons - it takes //TODO comments drom a string-variables..
